# Electives and Career Recommendation System with NL Interface
An AI recommendation system using Prolog and Python. The advisory system
takes input from the user about his/her interests and hobbies, the field of knowledge, back-
ground information, and study area. Based on analysis of the userâ€™s interests, the AI system
recommends various electives at IIITD that they can pursue and possible career choices. Pro-
log and Python were used, and natural language processing techniques were used to process
input using libraries such as NLTK and PortStemmer.
